# Genetic maze traversal 
> University project

## Description
>The goal of the script is to find a solution to a 2D maze with the genetic algorithm method
>
>Inside enviroment.py you can see that there are some enviroment settings that can be manipulated in order
to change the behaviour of the algorithm.
>
> An expansion idea would be to bind those settings into a user interface.
